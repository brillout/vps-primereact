PrimeReact is wrongly published (see https://github.com/primefaces/primereact/issues/4675).

This example uses [this workaround](https://github.com/brillout/vps-primereact/commit/9dc650bbddeac3ef78ece36596fc30f478fa238e) to make it work until PrimeReact fixes the issue. (For more information see discussion at https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/discussions/1023.)
